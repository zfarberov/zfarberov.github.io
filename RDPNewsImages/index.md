# RDP News Images

## Introduction

"A picture is worth a thousand words"- they say.  

But be that as it may, we find that pictures or, nowdays, digital images, capture of our life.  As life is refelected in news, and images are an indelible part of news, images also are an important part of RDP news.  

Refinitiv Data Platform (RDP) provides access to a broad range of content including rich slef-described news and images that are part of news.

Next, we are going to talk about requesting images that are a part of RDP news.  Currently, RDP Top News and RDP News Reports Online are the two types of news that are made available with images.

## RDP News Common Setup

To interacting with RDP platform we require valid RDP credentials and next we would:
1. Setup to access RDP via API
2. Load Credentials
3. Authenticate and btain a valid token
These steps are included in the companion code examples hosted on GitHub (see links in References section) and are also described in detail in many RDP articles, for example [https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/exploring-news-metadata-refinitiv-data-platform-and-python](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/exploring-news-metadata-refinitiv-data-platform-and-python), therefore, we feel we can ommit the detailed discussion of these steps here and next we focus on RDP images.
